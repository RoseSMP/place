# RoseSMP Place
This is the RoseSMP r/place server plugin. Originally created in April 2022 as an expirement by fizz, published as "place.fizz.red", it has become a highly requested game to be reimplemented. This plugin is basically v2 of it.

I am aware that this code is trash, feel free to send in a pull request.

There is no guide to install the plugin yet, as this is mainly made for just us. However, I reccomend looking at the source code to understand how it works before installing it.
